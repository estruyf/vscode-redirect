# Visual Studio Code - Redirect

This repository contains a simple redirect for Visual Studio Code to allow you using a URI handler for your desktop instance and codespaces like GitHub and GitPod.

It was created because the official URI handler (https://vscode.dev/redirect) for Visual Studio Code is not working for GitPod.
